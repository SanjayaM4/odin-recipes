        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Black rice, also known as purple rice, is a range of rice types of the species Oryza sativa, some of which are glutinous rice. There are several varieties of black rice available today.</p>
        <p>Black rice is one of the handful of superfoods. This rice is so flavorful and has a very unique presentation as it cooks up to a deep purple color. This rice goes great with just about any meal as a nice healthy side. I love to make it with salmon and a side of fresh veggies.</p>
